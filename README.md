# PHSX815_Week1
This repository is to fulfill the requirements for HW 1 in PHSX 815. 

I also need to learn markdown so I will practice a few things from the [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) provided by github. 

`fprintf('hello world')` since Matlab is the current programing language that I mainly use, but I still know Python basics `print('Hello World')`

Does this really let you include ![images](1532618604036.jpg)?

Some of the items in the cheat sheet don't seem to work specifically, the ==highlight== and the~subscript~. Although this~might~work. Nope it didn't.

That's enough for now. Onto other HW.
